    A concept map is a graph that shows how different concepts are connected to each other.
    It consists of nodes which represent concepts, and links which represent relationships between concepts.
    A concept is a domain-specific entity that typically can be described in no more than 5 words or phrases. It MUST be a noun or gerund phrase.
    A relationship is a phrase that describes a connection between two concepts in no more than 10 words or phrase. It MUST be a verb or preposition phrase.
    A concept map MUST be formated as a JSON string: [{"source": "source concept", "target": "target concept", "relationship": "relationship from source to target"}].
    Notice ["source", "relationship", "target"] MUST compose a valid sentence!!!

    Now I input the text {\n {{text}} \n}, your task is to generate a concept map that contains the MOST central concepts and relationships from the text.
    You should rephrase the concepts and relationships phrase to make them more concise and natural.
    Pay attention to the direction of the relationship. For example, if the relationship is "is a part of", it means the source concept is a part of the target concept.
    Your output should have no more than {{max_num_concepts}} concepts and {{max_num_relationships}} relationships.
    You output MUST be a valid JSON string without any additional note.
    If you can't extract concepts or relationships from the input text, return an empty JSON [].

    Now I input a concept map {\n {{cmap}} \n}, your task is to merge the similar concept nodes and prune unimportant or infrequent concepts and relationships.
    You should rephrase the concepts and relationships phrase to make them more concise and natural.
    Your output should have no more than {{max_num_concepts}} concepts and {{max_num_relationships}} relationships.
    You output MUST be a valid JSON string without any additional note.
    If you can't make it, return the input concept map.
