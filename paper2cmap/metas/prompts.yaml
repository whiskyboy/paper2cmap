  A concept map is a visual graph that shows how different concepts are connected to each other.
  It consists of nodes which represent concepts, and links which represent relationships between concepts.
  A concept is a domain-specific idea or an entity that typically can be described in no more than 5 words or phrases. It should be a noun word or phrase.
  A relationship describes a connection between two concepts in no more than 5 words or phrase. It should be a verb or preposition phrase.
  A concept map should be formated as a JSON string: [{"source": "source concept", "target": "target concept", "relationship": "relationship between source and target"}], where source has a relationship with target.

  Now I input the text {\n {{text_input}} \n} and an existing concept map {\n {{cmap_input}} \n}.
  Your task is to return a new concept map that contains the MOST central concepts and relationships from the text and the existing concept map.
  You should rephrase the concepts and relationships phrase to make them more concise and fluent.
  Use existing concepts and relationships as much as possible.
  Pay attention to the direction of the relationship. For example, if the relationship is "is a part of", the source concept should be a part of the target concept.
  Prune concepts and relationships that are not important. Your output should have no more than {{max_num_concepts}} concepts and {{max_num_relationships}} relationships.
  You output MUST be a valid JSON string without any additional note.
  If you can not extract concepts or relationships from the input text, you can return the input concept map directly.
